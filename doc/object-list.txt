Models
======

- Player ship model
  + Attachable phasers
  + Attachable missile launcher
  + Attachable mine deployer
  + Attachable warp drive
  + Attachable shield generator
  + Attachable spread shot
  + Upon death, ship will split up into fragments (probably best to do this
    with separate models)
  + Ship should have surfaces that can be tinted a certain color (see SC2
    units) to distinguish between teams.

- UFO1 model
  + Large, clunky, can't aim well

- UFO2 model
  + Small, smart, predictive targeting, evasive manouvering

- Asteroid models
  + 4 different sizes

- Phaser shot
  + Short beam of light. Only emissive material, will use bloom shader.

- Missile
- Mine
- Spread shot
- Missile Power-up (collectable container)
- Mine Power-up (collectable container)
- Warp drive Power-up (collectable container)
- Shield generator Power-up (collectable container)
- Spread shot Power-up (collectable container)

Worlds
======

- Planet 1
  + Just a sphere, no obstacles

- Planet 2
  + Has some obstacles (in the form of mountains, trees, cities?)

- Planet 3
  + Maze-like planet with artificial walls that extend up into the atmosphere

- Skybox of space?

Effects
=======

These may or may not need 3D modeling:

- Shield
- Ship explosion (used for player and UFO deaths)
- Phaser impact
- Missile explosion
- Missile trail
- Mine explosion
- Warp effect
